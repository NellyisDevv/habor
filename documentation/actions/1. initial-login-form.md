# Initial Login Form

- The last thing we will add to our site is authentication.

- There are some topics in react router 6 that require us to know basic knowledge on user authentication.

- This lesson basically introduces us to the form that we are using on our initial login form on our website, this is very easy but if you forget how to do this look it up on your challenge!

- The reason why we are going to use authentication to talk about react router 6 is because of our host route. We want to make it so that our host route or page is a protected route. Which means you have to login before you can go to this host route. Right now anyone can go in and see all of the vans whether or not they are logged in.
