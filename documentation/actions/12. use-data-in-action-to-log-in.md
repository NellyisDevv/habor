# Use data in action to log in

- Now that our action function is replacing our handleSubmit function we can move the loginUser function inside of it and then call it using async await and passing through it the email and password which is what its expecting to check if the user exists inside of mirage.js

- Although this means that we can remove the handleChange and the formData state since action function is taking care of that we are still not able to remove our error and setError state, but we will see in the following lessons that we can eventually remove this.

```js
export async function action({ request }) {
  const formData = await request.formData()
  const email = formData.get('email')
  const passwrd = formData.get('password')
  const data = await loginUser({ email, password })
  console.log(data)

  return null
}
```
