# Better (but still fake) auth

- In our AuthRequired component we are still hard coding that the user is still logged in.

- Although we will not work with real authentication and using authentication context to save the user across the entire app. We do want to make it to where when we log into our form it remembers that we are logged in and we would also be able to log out and see how our app reacts to that.

```js
export default function AuthRequired() {
  const isLoggedIn = true

  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    return <Navigate to='/login?message=You must log in first' />
  }

  return <Outlet />
}
```

```js
/**
 * Challege: save the logged in state to localStorage
 * 1. When the user logs in, save a value called "loggedin"
 *    to localStorage, and set it to `true`.
 * 2. In requireAuth, check if the value of "loggedin" in
 *    localStorage is `true` instead of hardcoding it like
 *    it is currently
