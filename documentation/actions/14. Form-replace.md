# Form replace

- This file will be an explaination of the "History Stack."

- The idea behind the history stack is that your browser maintains an array of locations that your browser has visited.

- Under the hood when you transition from one route to another in react router its automatically pushing new entries to the history stack for you so you can use your browsers back and forwards button exactly how you would expect it to work.

- if you went to the home page it would take you to the `/` stack then if you goto the about page it would take you to the `/about` stack then if you hit the back button on your browser you would go back to the `/` route and if you hit the forwards button it would take you back to the `/about` stack.

- When the user tries to visit `/host` they will get redirected to `/login` which gets added to our stack, but when they log in we redirect them to `/host`, meaning that if we hit the back button we redirect back to `/login` even if we are already logged in because this is how the history stack works.

## Fix

- On our login page we have a login form in which we can pass a very simple prop to the `Form` called replace. `<Form replace>`.

- Since the submittion of a form is considered a navigation event, this is similar to when we navigated the user back to host using useNavigate() `navigate('/host', { replace: true })`.

- This basically means forget the current route that you are on in the history stack and just replace the current route `/login` and replace it with `/host`.

## App idea

- When the user is logged in the login should conditionally render log out and this log out can have an onClick event handler that can go ahead and log the user out by using the `localStorage.removeItem('loggedin')` and redirecting us back to the log in page.
