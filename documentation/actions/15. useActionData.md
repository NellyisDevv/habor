# useActionData

- When an error occurs inside of our action function its going to exit out of the regular element flow of our route defention `element={<Login />}`, and its going to look for the nearest errorElement.

- Right now with our forms if the user gets their login the page gets completely replaced with an error page. We don't want this, instead we want to just show a message on the same page telling them the user credentials was not correct.

- Inside of our action if we return something like a string that says "Couldn't log in" this gives us a chance inside of our component to recieve the data that we are returning for our action function and display the message on the actual component. Remember when we submit the form using react router dom the page does not refresh!

```js
export async function action({ request }) {
  const formData = await request.formData()
  const email = formData.get('email')
  const password = formData.get('password')
  return "Couldn't log in"
}
```

- In order to grab data from an action function it works very similarly to grabbing data returned from a loader function, with a hook.

- The hook is called useActionData, so we have to import it.

- We can then put this error inside of a varaible and remember this will have to be conditionally rendered this is because error only gets a value returned to it if the action function runs and the action function will only run if the submit button is clicked on the Form.

```js
import { Form, useActionData } from 'react-router-dom'

export default function Login() {
  const error = useActionData()

  return <div>{error && <h4>{error}</h4>}</div>
}
```

# Action error handling

- This scrimb was a quick challenege here are the details.

```js
/**
 * Challenge: add a try...catch block that attempts to log the user
 * in with `fakeLoginUser({email, password}). If it's successful,
 * redirect the user to the /protected route. If there's an error,
 * return the error message that gets thrown from the fakeLoginUser
 * function.
 */
```

```js
export async function action({ request }) {
  const formData = await request.formData()
  const email = formData.get('email')
  const password = formData.get('password')
  try {
    const user = await fakeLoginUser({ email, password })
    return redirect('/protected')
  } catch (err) {
    return err.message
  }
}

export default function Login() {
  const errorMessage = useActionData()
  return (
    <Form method='post' replace>
      <h2>Login</h2>
      {errorMessage && <h4 className='red'>{errorMessage}</h4>}
      <input type='email' name='email' placeholder='Email address' />
      <br />
      <input type='password' name='password' placeholder='Password' />
      <br />
      <button>Log in</button>
    </Form>
  )
}
```
