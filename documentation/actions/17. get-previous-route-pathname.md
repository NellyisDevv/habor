# Get previous route pathname

- We want to make sure that when we log in and try to access a nested route inside a protected route, if the user is redirected to the login page when they log in they are taken to the nested route and not just a hard coded path.

- Because we are using the Data Layer API this is a pretty simple process, because our loaders and our actions both have access to the request object we have destructured.

- Now we can get some different information from the request object and one of those things is the url of the route itself or in other words the route that the loader/action function is inside of.

- We can use the Native URL constructor to construct the request.url that we are getting from the loader funciton, this gives us a URL object.

- Now with this url object we can access properties like `pathname`, the result is the pathname `/protected` is listed and if we go inside of the protected route we get the pathname of the protected route.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { redirect, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
import { requireAuth } from './requireAuth'

export async function loader({ request }) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  console.log(url.pathname)
  await requireAuth()
  return null
}

export default function Protected() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Super secret info here</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </>
  )
}
```
