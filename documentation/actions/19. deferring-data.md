# Deferring data

- The benefit of the loader is that we can write our code as if the data already exists, this is because the loader will render first and only if that data has rendered successfully will the component render.

- Inside of the weather application that we are building when the user clicks on the weather link nothing happens for 3 seconds. This is bad UX, although as the developer we know that the data is being loaded the user does not know this.

- We want to implement a way for the user to know that their data is being loaded onto the screen. We will use deffered data to give us a chance to bring back the UX by transitioning to the route as soon as the user clicks it and use an API to render some type of loading state (Without having to use any react state).
