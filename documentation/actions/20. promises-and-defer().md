# Promises and defer()

## Promises Refresher

- When a function is an async function it will always return a promise.

- So when we say await before an api/function fetch that is an indication that the api/function retruns a promise.

- Await can only be used on a function that is returning a promise.

- We can see this because in our utils.js `getWeather()` is an async function which means no matter what it will always return a promise.

- When we return something at the end of an async function what we are actually returning is a promise and if that promise is succesful then we will return some data.

- This is important because our async loader is waiting for the await getWeather() to finish, and getWeather() is waiting 3 full seconds before it even starts the fetch request.

```js
// Weather.jsx
export async function loader() {
  const weather = await getWeather()
  return weather
}
// utils.js
export async function sleep(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve()
    }, ms)
  })
}

export async function getWeather() {
  await sleep(3000)
  const res = await fetch(
    'https://apis.scrimba.com/openweathermap/data/2.5/weather?q=Salt+Lake+City&units=imperial'
  )
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw {
      error: 'Problem getting weather info',
    }
  }
  const data = await res.json()
  return data
}
```

- This means that the loader will need to be complete before the component even gets rendered by react. This is good for us because if the component renders we know the useLoaderData will be useable by us no matter what.

- In order to bring back the benefits of switching to a route immediatly before kicking off the request in our loader function we need to import a utility from react router dom called `defer`.

- This tells react that the loader function is able to wait or defer the loading of our weather data inside of the loader to a later point and therefore will not block the user interface from loading.

- In other words it wont stop the Weather component from loading even if our loader is not completely loaded.

- Since weather is still the actual value since we are using the await keyword which is pausing the execution of the loader function (3 seconds), so we need to get rid of await which means weather is no longer the resolved data from `getWeather()`.

- This means that weather is now a promise object, we can rename it to `weatherPromise` to be more specific.

- What defer expects is an object, and the key of that object is what we want to call the data that eventually get resolved when the promise gets resolved.

- What we want to pass to it is the promise that needs to get resolved and become the weather data that will get passed down to `useLoaderData()`.

- In the bottom lines of code I have a before and after, notice the differences and explain them out loud.

```js
// After
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { useLoaderData, defer } from 'react-router-dom'
import { sleep, getWeather } from './utils'

export async function loader() {
  const weatherPromise = getWeather()
  return defer({ weather: weatherPromise })
}

export default function Weather() {
  const loaderData = useLoaderData()
  const iconUrl = `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${loaderData.weather[0].icon}@2x.png`

  return (
    <section className='weather-container'>
      <h1>Weather in Salt Lake City</h1>
      <h3>{loaderData.main.temp}ºF</h3>
      <img src={iconUrl} />
    </section>
  )
}
// Before
import React, { Suspense } from "react"
import { useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom"
import { sleep, getWeather } from "./utils"

export async function loader() {
    const weather = await getWeather()
    return weather
}

export default function Weather() {
    const loaderData = useLoaderData()
    const iconUrl =
        `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${loaderData.weather[0].icon}@2x.png`

    return (
        <section className="weather-container">
            <h1>Weather in Salt Lake City</h1>
            <h3>{loaderData.main.temp}ºF</h3>
            <img src={iconUrl} />
        </section>
    )
}
```
