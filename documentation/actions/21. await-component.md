# Await component

- If we try to access our weather page after using the defer code we will see that the page will be broken.

- This is because its no longer the case that the component will wait for the loader data to finish to render the component.

- We are allowing the loader to defer for a later time and no longer awaiting our `getWeather()` call.

```js
export async function loader() {
  const weatherPromise = getWeather()
  return defer({ weather: weatherPromise })
}
```

## Step One

- Import Await from react router dom.

- Await always us to surrond the code that we will be waiting for when this component starts to render and conditionally render only after the data has finished loading.

```js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { useLoaderData, defer, Await } from 'react-router-dom'
import { sleep, getWeather } from './utils'

export async function loader() {
  const weatherPromise = getWeather()
  return defer({ weather: weatherPromise })
}

export default function Weather() {
  const loaderData = useLoaderData()
  const iconUrl = `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${loaderData.weather[0].icon}@2x.png`

  return (
    <section className='weather-container'>
      <h1>Weather in Salt Lake City</h1>
      <Await></Await>
      <h3>{loaderData.main.temp}ºF</h3>
      <img src={iconUrl} />
    </section>
  )
}
```

## Step Two

- We use the `resolve` prop because we want to pass the promise from the data we want to get to the `resolve` prop.

- We are going to get the promise from the object that we entered into the defer, which is being obtained by the loaderData variable that requals the `useLoaderData()`.

- When we log loader data we see we get the object that we passed to defer `{weather: Promise {}}`. This is the promise that we need to pass to resolve.

```js
export async function loader() {
  const weatherPromise = getWeather()
  return defer({ weather: weatherPromise })
}

export default function Weather() {
  const loaderData = useLoaderData()
  console.log(loaderData)

  return (
    <section className='weather-container'>
      <h1>Weather in Salt Lake City</h1>
      <Await resolve={loaderData.weather}></Await>
    </section>
  )
}
```

- Under the hood the Await component will take that promise and after its resolved it calls a render prop child function.

- High level overview: we can pass a child to a component and that child does not need to be another component. Instead we can pass a function and the code of that component can take the function and run it passing any arguments to it that it wants to.

- The Await component uses render props as a child and when our promise finally gets resolved it will pass to the function the loadedWeather (we can call it whatever we want).

- loadedWeather will be the data that we used to be calling `loaderData`.

- Inside of this function we can have access to our loadedWeather, when we log our loadedWeather what we actually get is the api call returned back to us, which is exactly what the loaderData used to return.

- Because the Await component will only render the children inside of the render prop (the child function) after it has finished resolving our data, we can again like in our original setup be sure that loadedWeather WILL exist.

- We will return the markup that we want to display when the loadedWeather is finished loading.

```js
<section className='weather-container'>
  <h1>Weather in Salt Lake City</h1>
  <Await resolve={loaderData.weather}>
    {loadedWeather => {
      console.log(loadedWeather)
      const iconUrl = `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${loadedWeather.weather[0].icon}@2x.png`
      return (
        <>
          <h3>{loadedWeather.main.temp}ºF</h3>
          <img src={iconUrl} />
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Await>
</section>
```

## Overview

- We added an Await wrapper around the code that we want to display after the data is loaded while using the defer, we put that markup inside of a child function that will recieve the successfully loaded weather and allow us to return whatever user interface that allows on having that succesfully loaded weather.
