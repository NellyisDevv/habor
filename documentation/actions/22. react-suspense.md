# React Suspense

- We still have two issues, the first issue is that our page is completely blank until all of the data is finally loaded in.

- The second issue is that if we goto another route and try to go back into the route that is using the Await Component / defered data we get an error "A component suspended while responding to synchronous input."

- Suspense is going to allow us to fix both of those things.

## Step One

- React allows thrid party libraries to suspend rendering of our react application until something has finished.

- Meaning we can treat our components as if they were synchronous.

- We use Suspense to wrap our Await component or in other words the component that will not wait for the loader to finish before loading up the component.

```js
<React.Suspense>
  <Await resolve={loaderData.weather}>
    {loadedWeather => {
      const iconUrl = `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${loadedWeather.weather[0].icon}@2x.png`
      return (
        <>
          <h3>{loadedWeather.main.temp}ºF</h3>
          <img src={iconUrl} />
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Await>
</React.Suspense>
```

## Step Two

- Finally, we have to provide a prop called `fallback`, this gives react an element to render while its waiting for the other component that is suspending to finish.

- Be careful where you place this because it will suspend anything that is within it!

```js
<React.Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading weather...</h2>}>
  <Await resolve={loaderData.weather}>
    {loadedWeather => {
      const iconUrl = `http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/${loadedWeather.weather[0].icon}@2x.png`
      return (
        <>
          <h3>{loadedWeather.main.temp}ºF</h3>
          <img src={iconUrl} />
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Await>
</React.Suspense>
```

## defer

- The reason why we use `defer` as an object is because if we wanted to include any additional data like the user, we would have different Await/Suspense boundaries depending on what data we want to display first.

```js
export function loader() {
  return defer({ vans: getVans(), user: getUser() })
}
```

- Also if there was a piece of data that we HAD to include before the component rendered we could turn our loader back into an async function and await the property in the defer object and it would automatically resolve that promise meaning that `useLoaderData` would get it before the component rendered.

- Since the loader has to complete before we render the component the loader will wait for getUser and then it will load up the component whether or not the getVans() fetch is done or not.

```js
export async function loader() {
  return defer({ vans: getVans(), user: await getUser() })
}
```
