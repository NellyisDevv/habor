# Parallel Loaders Demo

- This lesson covers how react router is not waiting for one loader to finish before moving on to the next loader, meaning they are truely parallel loaders or in other words loading all at the same time asyncronously from each other.

- There isn't any notes for this since its a pretty simple concept but if you want to see this in action again here is the link to the scrimb that goes over this (`https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6/parallel-loaders-demo-co4584612bb31ea207630373d`).

- This helps to see why using the parent route method would not work, one thing to think about is what if the child route loads up first?
