# Setting up for authentication - happy path

- We are going to cover the difference between working with forms in react and why they are more complex then react native forms which have their own state management systems and submission abilities.

## Challenge One

- Inside of the server.js bob set up a fake user inside of the models and included it in our server / fake database that we have.

```js
 models: {
        vans: Model,
        users: Model
    },

server.create('user', {
  id: '123',
  email: 'b@b.com',
  password: 'p123',
  name: 'Bob',
})
```

- Bob also created an endpoint for login which is finding the fake user in our database and if the provided crentials, which is the `{email, password}` match the user in our fake database then it will return the user object containing `user: foundUser`, and a fake token.

-

```js
       this.post("/login", (schema, request) => {
            const { email, password } = JSON.parse(request.requestBody)
            // This is an extremely naive version of authentication. Please don't
            // do this in the real world, and never save raw text passwords
            // in your database 😇
            const foundUser = schema.users.findBy({ email, password })
            if (!foundUser) {
                return new Response(401, {}, { message: "No user with those credentials found!" })
            }

            // At the very least, don't send the password back to the client 😅
            foundUser.password = undefined
            return {
                user: foundUser,
                token: "Enjoy your pizza, here's your tokens."
            }
        })
    }
```

- There is also a new function inside of our api.js file called loginUser, which is the interface we are using.

- It makes the fetch request for us inside of the api login page and send back any errors that might come back from our request, but otherwise it will return the data to us.

```js
export async function loginUser(creds) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/login', {
    method: 'post',
    body: JSON.stringify(creds),
  })
  const data = await res.json()

  if (!res.ok) {
    throw {
      message: data.message,
      statusText: res.statusText,
      status: res.status,
    }
  }

  return data
}
```

- This challenge was solved on video here is a link ``

```js
/**
 * Challenge: hook up our form so it (halfway) works.
 *
 * 1. Pull in the `loginUser` function from the api.js file
 * 2. Call loginUser when the form is submitted and console.log
 *    the data that comes back. Use "b@b.com" as the username and
 *    "p123" as the password.
 *
 *    NOTE: loginUser returns a promise, so you'll need
 *    a .then(data => {...}) to access the data, or use
 *    a separate aync function defined inside handleSubmit
 * 3. TBA

# Setting up for authentication - sad path

- This challenge was solved on video here is a link ``

```js
/**
 * Challenge: Code the sad path 🙁
 * 3. Add a `status` state and default it to "idle". When the
 *    login form begins submitting, set it to "submitting". When
 *    it's done submitting (whether successful or not), set it
 *    to "idle" again.
 * 4. Disable the button when the `status` state is "submitting"
 *    (this may require some Googling if you haven't done this
 *    before).
 * 5. Add an `error` state and default it to `null`. When the
 *    form is submitted, reset the errors to `null`. If there's
 *    an error from `loginUser` (add a .catch(err => {...}) in
 *    the promise chain), set the error to the error that
 *    comes back.
 * 6. Display the error.message below the `h1` if there's ever
 *    an error in state
