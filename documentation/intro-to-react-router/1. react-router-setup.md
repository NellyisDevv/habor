# React Router Setup & BrowserRouter

## Installation

### Step One

- NPM install react router

```js
npm i react-router-dom
```

### Step Two

- Import Browser Router.

```js
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
```

### Step Three

- BrowserRouter under the hood is a context provider, meaning we have to wrap our entire app with BrowserRouting to give it the ability to include routing.

- We now have lots of tools we can use with react router dom that we can use to control our application.

```js
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
)
```

- Out in the wild you may see that developers will rename BrowserRouter as just Router like you see below, this allows for a shoter name.

```js
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom'
```
