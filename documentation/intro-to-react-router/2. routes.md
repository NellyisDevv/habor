# Routes

### Define Routes

- Since BrowserRouter is the provider we need to find a way to set up the routes we want in our application.

- We will start with a home and about route, first we import routes which is the first child in the BrowserRouter component.

```js
import { BrowserRouter, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes></Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
)
```

- Next we will have to import another component called Route.

- A route is part of your URL that specifies where on your website you are.

```js
// example.com/ (Home page usually has the trailing /)
// example.com/about (About page)
// example.com/contact (Contact page)
// They can also be nested
// example.com/blog/blog-article-1
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
```
