# Route, Path & Element

## Step One

- We will now cover the `Route` component which we will also need to import.

- Everthing will now basically happen within the route component we just imported.

```js
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
```

## Step Two

- Route is self closing (at least the most basic way) and can take in different props, the first is path (where we specify what the path to this route should be). For example home would be `path='/'` and about would be `path='/about'`.

- The second argument will tell the Route component which react element we want to render if the path in the URL bar matches the path we defined in our route.

- Since we want to render our App component we would render the compoents name with the parenthesis after, this is because we actually want the function to run, if we just put `App` instead of `App()` this will not work.

```js
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path='/' element={App()} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
)
```

- Another way this will work is if we just render the component, also we can now make different routes for different pages.

- Now when we visit /about in the browser our About function component will run, and / will direct us to the App component, this all happens within the URL of your browser.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, React Router!</h1>
  )
}

function About() {
  return (
    <h1>About page goes here!</h1>
  )
}

<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<App />}>
    <Route path='/about' element={<About />}>
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

## Moving Our Code

- Right now we are using the ReactDOM to go ahead and do all of our routing, instead we can use the `App()` component to do all of this for us and create a new component called `Home()` to go ahead and handle our home content.

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
        <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}

function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, React Router!</h1>
}

function About() {
  return <h1>About page goes here! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```
