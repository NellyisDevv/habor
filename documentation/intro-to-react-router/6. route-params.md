# Route Params - Part 1

## Sub Pages For Products

- Right now we are able to able to see all of the products offered by the website, but what if a user wants to click on one of these items and purchase it?

- We could make a route for each product, but this would take a very long time if we had 100s of products, and if we wanted to add new products in the future we would have to keep manually creating new routes.

- To solve this we are going to learn about nested routes, first we will cover the more difficult way to do this then the more simple way. (This is because we first have to learn about params or route paramaters).

```js
<Routes>
  <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
  <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
  <Route path='/vans' element={<Vans />} />
  <Route path='/vans/1' element={<Vans />} />
  <Route path='/vans/2' element={<Vans />} />
  <Route path='/vans/3' element={<Vans />} />
  <Route path='/vans/4' element={<Vans />} />
</Routes>
```

- Instead of making new routes for every products id number (or some other text) we will use a colon (:) and some sort of id name which we will name id.

- Because the colon turns this into a variable we can reuse this single route defention for every single detail page that we want to create no matter what the id is going to be.

- We will create a VanDetail page, or in your case create a product detail page, and make sure that the path renders the detail page.

```js
<Routes>
  <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
  <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
  <Route path='/vans' element={<Vans />} />
  <Route path='/vans/:id' element={<VanDetail />} />
</Routes>
```

- In the URL tab in the browser we can now go into different routes like `/vans/1` or `/shop/42` and this will render up the detail page and display whatever is inside of that component.

- This means that `/:id` just means something is going to be at the end of the URL, we don't need to know what that is.

- What we want to happen is when we click on a product to send us the the url of `/shop/` and then the id of that product so that product will appear and not any other product. And in the van detail page we want someway to access that ID that is inside of the URL after `/shop`, then we can grab the id from the URL and make a GET request to our server to grab that detailed information for that one van.

- We can acheive this by wrapping our entire div that renders each and every van with a Link from react router. Then because each van is being iterated over and given an ID property to individually render them we can link to the van id nested inside of the vans page like so /vans/theVansId.

```js
const vanElements = vans.map(van => (
  <div key={van.id} className='van-tile'>
    <Link to={`/vans/${van.id}`}>
      <img src={van.imageUrl} />
      <div className='van-info'>
        <h3>{van.name}</h3>
        <p>
          ${van.price}
          <span>/day</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <i className={`van-type ${van.type} selected`}>{van.type}</i>
    </Link>
  </div>
))
```

- Next we will make sure this nested detail page can grab information about the specific product/van that they clicked on so that we can display it to the user, to achieve this we will have to learn about something called useParams().
