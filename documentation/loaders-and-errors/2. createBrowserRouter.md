# createBrowserRouter

- Before we can take advantage of any of the data layer api in react router we need to change the way that we are creating/instanciating our router.

- Here is a list of the routes that don't allow the use of the Data API.

```js
<BrowserRouter>
<MemoryRouter>
<HashRouter>
<NativeRouter>
<StaticRouter>
```

- Here is a list of the routes that allow the use of the Data API.

```js
createBrowserRouter
createMemoryRouter
createHashRouter
```

- What we were doing before is just importing browser router and just inserting an instance of browser router.

```js
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
;<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<HomePage />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

## Using Browser Router

## Step One

- Import createBrowserRouter. The lowercase c means this is not a component instead a function that we are going to run.

```js
import { createBrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
```

## Step Two

- We can set the function to a variable called router.

```js
const router = createBrowserRouter()
```

- What we have been doing is determining our routes based on a series of nested components.

- What we didn't know is that the `<Routes>` component under the hood is taking every `<Route>` we have nested inside of it and just turning it into a plan JavaScript object. Its taking all the children and turning it into an array of route objects.

```js
[
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <HomePage />
    children: [
      {
        // Other nested components
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Step Three

- We will import createRoutesFromElements in order to convert our code from using BrowserRouter to using createBrowserRouter().

```js
import {
  BrowserRouter,
  createBrowserRouter,
  createRoutesFromElements,
  Routes,
  Route,
} from 'react-router-dom'
```

## Step Four

- What we will do is call createRoutesFromElements inside of createVrowserRouter and this way we can place our `<Route />` paths directly inside of it.

- This will basically turn our Route component into an object then pass that object to `createBrowserRouter()`.

- In the future we can keep writing out our paths as components and then convert them, but this may or not be best practices depending on what team you are working on.

```js
const router = createBrowserRouter(
  createRoutesFromElements(<Route path='/' element={<HomePage />} />)
)

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<HomePage />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```

## Step Five

- Now we need to replace browser router meaning we will have to import RouterProvider.

```js
import {
  RouterProvider,
  createBrowserRouter,
  createRoutesFromElements,
  Routes,
  Route,
} from 'react-router-dom'
```

- We can also clear the entire App() function and replace everything inside with a new router by using the router provider and pass it a prop called router.

- The value of `router` needs to be the value of the router variable of the createBrowserRouter created.

```js
const router = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElements(
  <Route path='/' element={<HomePage />}>
))

function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router}>
  )
}
```

## Overview

- We have three new inputs, `RouterProvider`, `createBrowserRouter`, and `createRoutesFromElements`.

- Then outside of the function where we are going to be using the `<RouterProvider />` that contains a router prop with our value of router that we are getting from our router variable containing our createBrowserRouter() which also contains our createRoutesFromElements that converts our Route components into objects that our createBrowserRouter() can then use.

- Here is the entire file for review purposes!

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import {
  RouterProvider,
  createBrowserRouter,
  createRoutesFromElements,
  Route,
} from 'react-router-dom'

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Home page</h1>
    </main>
  )
}

const router = createBrowserRouter(
  createRoutesFromElements(<Route path='/' element={<HomePage />} />)
)

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```
