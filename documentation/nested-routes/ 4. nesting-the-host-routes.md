# Nesting the /host routes

- We are now going to nest the different pages into the host route, we are going to start with this challenge on your own project!

- I believe one of the reasons why this is happening is because there is no outlet inside of our Dashboard page, meaning that we are basically just rendering up the entire page itself instead of letting the children routes render inside of a container.

```js
{
  /* 
          Challenge: 
          1. Turn the "/host" path into a parent route and nest
          "/host/income" and "/host/reviews" as children routes.
          Then try entering "/host/income" in the URL and see what
          happens.
          
          2. See if you can figure out why it did what it did.
          */
}
```

## How to fix issue

- Because right now our Dashboard is almost working like the layout route, it does not currently have an outlet to display any of the other data that we need, we can fix this by making an outlet.

- React router is deciding multiple routes and deciding that multiple things can go on the page at one time, when we nest routes into other routes we are basically displaying two different components at once.

- In our case the route `/host` is matching meaning that we will display our host page and if we use that as a parent route and outlet some other pages when we use `/host/income` we will display both the host component and the income component.

```js
// main.jsx
;<Route path='/host' element={<Dashboard />}>
  <Route path='/host/income' element={<Income />} />
  <Route path='/host/reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
</Route>

// Dashboard.jsx
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <DashContainer>
      <Outlet />
    </DashContainer>
  )
}
```

- The issue we are now facing is that the dashboard itself is a page, meaning if we use the outlet inside of it we will display the entire dashboard page on each and every nested route.
