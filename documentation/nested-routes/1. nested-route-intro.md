# Nested Routes Intro

## What is Nested Routes?

- Nesting Peices of the URL, for example /van and a nested route would be /van/van-id-or-name.

- Nested routes are also shared user interface or parts of the page that need to stay on the page when you transition from one route to a child route. (To see a live example of this watch this video again! `https://scrimba.com/learn/reactrouter6/nested-routes-intro-co96141cf9583023b063552cd`)

## How to create Nested Routes

- Right now we are using our `<Route>` components as self closing, meaning nothing is being nested.

```js
<Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
```

- We can however use `<Route>` as non self closing and nest items inside of it.

- The best reason to use Nested Routingis when you want to keep displaying some UI on the page, but also want to display more. (Linking to a new part of the website but website is only making a small UI change)
