# Outlet Context

- Right now three of our nested ProductsListedLayouts components are going back in and making their own reqest to get the information for the specific product we are looking at.

- The issue with this is that we are repeating our code, and we can make this more dry.

- Right now this code is being ran 3 different times! And this is for the sake of getting the products information to display in different components, but we can fix this with outlet context.

```js
const [product, setProduct] = React.useState(null)

const params = useParams()
const paramId = Number(params.id)

const mappedProduct = productsList.map(product =>
  product.id === paramId
    ? React.useEffect(() => {
        setProduct(product)
      }, [paramId])
    : null
)

console.log(product)
```

- Because we are already getting our information inside of our ProductsListedLayout or in other words the exact product we need, we can basically skip this step inside of its nested components.

## I wont be updating this since the video explanation I made was pretty good, instead check your youtube chanel for React Outlet Context.
