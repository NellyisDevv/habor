# Fixing the Navbar with a Layout Route

- We will go ahead and work towards fixing our navigation on the page.

- Right now our Nav is loading up through our BrowserRouter, but there is a better way to do this.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Nav />
      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
        <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
        <Route path='/shop' element={<Shop />} />
        <Route path='/shop/:id' element={<ProductDetail />} />
      </Routes>
      <Footer />
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```

## Challenge

- Something to note is that I already have a Header component but its called Nav.

```js
/**
 * Challenge: set up the code so we can use a layout route!
 *
 * 1. Create a folder called "components"
 * 2. Create 2 new component files: Layout.jsx and Header.jsx
 * 3. Move the <header> code below to the Header component file.
 *    (DON'T import that Header component here!)

```

# Fixing the Navbar with a Layout Route Part 2

- When the `<Route></Route>` Component with opening and closing tag takes children it has to be other `<Route>` components and not anything else like HTML markup.

```js
// Not allowed
<Route>
  <h1></h1>
</Route>

// Allowed
<Route>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="/vans" element={<Vans />} />
  <Route path="/vans/:id" element={<VanDetail />} />
</Route>
```

- This Route component is going to take any element we pass through it, in this case our Layout component. It will render the layout component and then which ever child route matches the URL that we are currently at.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route element={<Layout />}>
          <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
          <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
          <Route path='/shop' element={<Shop />} />
          <Route path='/shop/:id' element={<ProductDetail />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```

- When we reload our site it will not show any of our other pages only the content that we inserted inside of our `<Layouts />` component.

```js
function Layout() {
  return <h1>This is the Layout Route</h1>
}
```

- There is a special tool we can use to render the layout correct and also tell it exactly where to render whichever route we are currently matching on the URL.

- If we are at `/vans` we would want it to first render the Layout and then to render the `<Vans />` component.

## Outlet

- The tool we are going to use is called `Outlet` meaning we first have to import it.

```js
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
```

- Outlet is a way to create a hole in whatever our component is, where the matching route that is a child of the route that we are nesting can render inside of that hole.

- When we insert our `<Outlet />` component into our code what we get is the `<h1>` and then under it we get the page that is supposed to render up when we visit its corresponding route.

```js
export default function Layout() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>This is the Layout Route</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </>
  )
}
```

- Because we are nesting our routes into a parent route, react router is going to notice that `<Route element={<Layout />}>` does not have a path meaning it will always watch whatever current URL we are at, and render our Layout component.

- When it renders our layout component if we dont have a way to tell it where to put the rest of the matching child routes like `/vans` using `<Outlet />` then we will not render any of the child components.

- Knowing this we can make our navigation and footer work again!

```js
function Layout() {
  return (
    <>
      <Nav />
      <Outlet />
      <Footer />
    </>
  )
}
```

- Note: You may be able to use two navigation menus this video covers that!!!
