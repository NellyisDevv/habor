# Bootstrap the Host pages

- We will start this lesson with a challenge this will help you better manage your file system and organize your pages and components correctly making your app more managable over time and more understandable for other developers.

```js
/**
 * Challenge:
 * 1. Add a "Host" link to the Navbar that takes you to the "/host" path
 * 2. Create the following components in the pages/Host folder:
 *    a. Dashboard ("/host")
 *    b. Income ("/host/income")
 *    c. Reviews ("/host/reviews")
 *    These components can just have an h1 for now that says, e.g.
 *    "Host Dashboard here".
 * 3. Set up routes for each of these pages in the Routes below. FOR NOW,
 *    don't worry about nesting anything, you can just put them on the same
 *    level as the "/vans", etc. routes below.
