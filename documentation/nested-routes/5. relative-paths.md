# Relative Paths

- The way react router works under the hood is that when its looking at a child route like the following. Inside of the context itself (element) it knows that `/host` child is a child of the `/host` parent route that leads to `HostLayout`.

- This is because its nested as a child, this also means that we don't need to give the children elements absolute paths like `/host/income` and `/host/reviews`.

- Using relative paths is going to make our lives easier, it may not seem like it since we are not nesting lots of paths together but what if we had something like `/host/vans/:id/pricing`. If this was to grow into an even bigger site it would not be maintainable anymore.

```js
<Route path='/host' element={<HostLayout />}>
  <Route path='/host' element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path='/host/income' element={<Income />} />
  <Route path='/host/reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
</Route>
```

## Relative Route Fix

- The `/` should be dedicated for the very initial home page, if we write our route with a `/` react will treat it like an absolute path.

- If we don't use the `/` react will treat it like a relative route, which means its relative to the parent route.

- In the case of these first routes because the path is not defined in the layout (This is called a `pathless route`), react will automatically assume that `about / vans` are one of the first pages like the first section of the url `website.com/about`.

```js
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route element={<Layout />}>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
          <Route path="vans" element={<Vans />} />
          <Route path="vans/:id" element={<VanDetail />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
```

- If we get carried away and remove the `/` from our parent route that is also a layout we will get an error.

- This is happening because the child `host` is now relative to the parent `host`. Meaning that to get to the dashboard we would have to visit `/host/host` and for the other paths like income we would have to visit `/host/host/income`.

```js
<Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
  <Route path='host' element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path='host/income' element={<Income />} />
  <Route path='host/reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
  <Route path='host/products' element={<Products />} />
</Route>
```

- To fix this we can remove `host/` from all of the children because they are already relative to the parent meaning react router will already assume `/host`.

```js
<Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
  <Route path='host' element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path='income' element={<Income />} />
  <Route path='reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
  <Route path='products' element={<Products />} />
</Route>
```

- Now if we wanted to goto a route like `/host/products/123` instead of writting it absolute we could do something like this.

- Although the `<ProductDetail />` component already exists we will assume it does not, but now that products is a parent route and it has a child of `:id` react router will automaticall give us the route of `/products/:id` without having to write out the entire absolute path making the entire URL path `https://www.website.com/host/products/:id`.

```js
<Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
  <Route path='host' element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path='income' element={<Income />} />
  <Route path='reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
  <Route path='products' element={<Products />}>
    <Route path=':id' element={<ProductDetail />}>
  </Route>
</Route>
```

- But what you might notice is that the `Dashboard` link is still broken this is because `host` is still a child of parent `host` and react is still redirecting us to `/host` instead of `/host/host` we will learn how to fix this issue in the next lesson.
