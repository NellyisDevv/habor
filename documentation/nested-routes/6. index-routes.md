# Index Routes

- We are going to fix the issue of having `/host/host` to get to our dashboard.

- Putting an element at the parent route is a very common thing to do when using react router.

```js
<Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
  <Route path='host' element={<Dashboard />} />
</Route>
```

- To fix this we need to let router know that there is a component we want to display alongside the layout component and not at some futher nested URL path like whats happening right now.

- To fix this we are going to use something called an Index Route, If we have an element that we want to display in the `<Outlet />` of the layout component and want it to be at the same route that the layout component is defined at we can replace our path with a prop (property) called `index`.

```js
<Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
  <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
</Route>
```

- You may think that index is like `/`, but the main difference is that react router will think of this as an absolute path and instead it will make create its own top level page instead.

- Actually you will just run into the error we see below!

```js
Uncaught Error: Absolute route path "/" nested under path "/host" is not valid. An absolute child route path must start with the combined path of all its parent routes.
```

- The difference between the first parent route with `<Layout />` and the second parent/child route with `<HostLayout />` is that the host layout will still inherit the `<Layout />` from the first parent route because its nested inside of it, and so will the children, but the routes that are a children of the `<HostLayout />` will only recieve that component and not the other routes like `<Route path="about" element={<About />} />`, which are not children.

- Finally we can make the change to this path to make sure that the layout is the only absolute path and the `/` with the Home component will render with the layout when we visit the `/` absolute path or the home page. (See if you can do this yourself)

```js
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route element={<Layout />}>
      <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
      <Route path='about' element={<About />} />
      <Route path='shop' element={<Shop />} />
      <Route path='shop/:id' element={<ProductDetail />} />

      <Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
        <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path='income' element={<Income />} />
        <Route path='products' element={<Products />} />
        <Route path='reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
      </Route>
    </Route>
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```
