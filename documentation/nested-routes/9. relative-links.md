# Relative Links

- We have covered relative route paths which allow us to nest routes into other routes and not have to use absolute paths `/`.

- Here the parent route is the / which contains the layout and an outlet which is going to render one of the children like the about or vans page, and to access these pages we dont have to use the absolute paths.

- Also the host is another parent nested within the first parent that shares a peice of UI and has a layout page with an outlet that renders up the subpages. Notice that nothing here uses absolute paths but to get to about we would do `/about` and to get to host we would goto `/host` and to get to the host income page we would do `/host/income`.

- Since the parent routes are already `/` its already assumed that it will have that in front of what ever child is provided.

```js
<BrowserRouter>
  <Routes>
    <Route path='/' element={<Layout />}>
      <Route index element={<Home />} />
      <Route path='about' element={<About />} />
      <Route path='vans' element={<Vans />} />
      <Route path='vans/:id' element={<VanDetail />} />

      <Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
        <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path='income' element={<Income />} />
        <Route path='reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
        <Route path='vans' element={<HostVans />} />
        <Route path='vans/:id' element={<HostVanDetail />} />
      </Route>
    </Route>
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

- We can also do this with navlinks, right now they are being written as absolute paths.

```js
<NavLink
  to='/host'
  end
  style={({ isActive }) => (isActive ? activeStyles : null)}
>
  Dashboard
</NavLink>
<NavLink
  to="/host/income"
  style={({ isActive }) => isActive ? activeStyles : null}
  >
  Income
</NavLink>
<NavLink
  to="/host/vans"
  style={({ isActive }) => isActive ? activeStyles : null}
 >
  Vans
</NavLink>
```

- We dont need to do this because the hostlayout is getting rendered by our `<Route path="host" element={<HostLayout />}>` which is already a child of the `<Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>` route, because our element in our first route is already a element for the path of host the element can assume the path of host in all of its links.

- Remember this will work because our `HostLayout()` is nested and rendered inside of the `<Route path="host" element={<HostLayout />}>` path.

```js
<NavLink
  to='/host'
  end
  style={({ isActive }) => (isActive ? activeStyles : null)}
>
  Dashboard
</NavLink>
<NavLink
  // /host is already assumed meaning we don't need it!
  to="income"
  style={({ isActive }) => isActive ? activeStyles : null}
  >
  Income
</NavLink>
<NavLink
  to="/host/vans"
  style={({ isActive }) => isActive ? activeStyles : null}
 >
  Vans
</NavLink>
```

- `cd ..` inside of our terminal gets us to our prior directory of the directory that we are currently in. And in UNIX we can also do `cd .` which represents the current directory that we are on.

- This is to help us understand that if we want to reference the directory that we are currently inside of we can just use `.` and this fixes the issue of the `/host` path!

```js
<NavLink
  // /host is the current directory so we can just use .
  to='.'
  end
  style={({ isActive }) => (isActive ? activeStyles : null)}
>
```

- This causes a new issue though, instead of taking us back to all of our products it will take us back to the dashboard and this is because `..` is not relative to the link path, instead its realtive to the nested routes, meaning that we dont go from `vans/:id` to `vans` instead we goto `host` which is the dashboard.

- In short terms we don't go up a route path we will go up a parent path which the parent path is host.

```js
<Route path='host' element={<HostLayout />}>
  <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
  <Route path='income' element={<Income />} />
  <Route path='reviews' element={<Reviews />} />
  <Route path='vans' element={<HostVans />} />
  // this route does not take us to `/vans` it takes us to `/host`
  <Route path='vans/:id' element={<HostVanDetail />} />
</Route>
```

- Instead we can pass a prop called `relative` which basically means we will not be relative to the path and not the route, meaning that instead of going back to host we will go back to the previous vans page or in other words vans.

```js
<Link to='..' relative='path' className='back-button'>
  &larr; <span>Back to all vans</span>
</Link>
```
