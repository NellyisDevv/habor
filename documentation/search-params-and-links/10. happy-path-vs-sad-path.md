# "Happy Path" vs "Sad Path"

- Data layers are something very new to react native and we are going to cover it here.

- To understand the Data layer API we need to first understand that so far in this application we have been coding what people call "Happy Path."

- This is when we build the application assuming the user is going to do everything that you expect when they are using the applcaiton, and everything will go according to plan.

- Coding this way may be great if you are building something quickly and need to show it to someone. But it does not account for errors or problems that occur in the real world.

- This is why you should also code the "Sad Path", which forces you to imagine what could go wrong and plan accordingly.

- This is where we have things like error handling, loading states, form validation, and other helpful user experience features.

## Example

- Bob actually altered the fake API server to return a 400 level response, which basically means things are broken.

```js
this.get('/vans', (schema, request) => {
  return new Response(400, {}, { error: 'Error fetching data' })
  // return schema.vans.all()
})
```

- If we goto our vans though we don't have any useful information that tells the user if the vans api struggled to load. So that the user could try again later or try to refresh the page, instead the application just completely crashes.
