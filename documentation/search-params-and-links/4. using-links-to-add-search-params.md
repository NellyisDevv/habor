# Using Links to add search params

- The most simple way to make the search params appear on the click of a button is to use `<Link  />`.

- We usually use the Link with the parameter of to, that allows us to know where that link is leading us.

```js
<Link to='path' />
```

- But we can also use the link to tell us what query paramter we wish to access.

```js
<Link to='?type=jedi'>Jedi</Link>
<Link to='?type=sith'>Sith</Link>
```

## Challenge

- My answer was just to go back to the same directory with the `.` symbol, since we are going back into the same directory it will remove the query parameter from the URL all together!

```js
/**
 * Challenge: add another Link that clears out the search params
 */

<div>
  <Link to='?type=jedi'>Jedi</Link>
  <Link to='?type=sith'>Sith</Link>
  <Link to='.'>Clear</Link>
</div>
```

- Bob had another good answer where instead he chose for it to equal nothing, in this case that also resets the URL.

```js
<Link to=''>Clear</Link>
```
