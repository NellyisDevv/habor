# Merging search params with links

- There has been a minor downfall to how we have been using query parameters up to this point.

- This is because its so common to have more than one query parameter with each one having to do with another part of the application and right now we are simply just hard coding these parameters into our setter.

- This is an issue because as soon as we click one of the buttons we will lose the context of the query selector that we are currently on, for example if we click the skincare button we get `?type=skincare` and then if we click the scents button we get `?type=scents` meaning we completely lose skincare every time.

- If you know for a fact that you will not have any other query selectors in your project the way we learned here will work perfectly, however we will learn other methods to merge our query parameters with existing query parameters instead of completely replacing them.
