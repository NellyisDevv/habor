# Link State

- Right now when we click on the "← Back to all products" link it takes us back to all of our products but also removes all of the filters.

- Imagine a website like airbnb where a user uses more than 4 filters sometimes. If the user had to reapply those same 4 filters every time they clicked on a condo and used the back button that would make for a terrible user experience.

- Right now we only have the choice for one filter at a time, but it would be nice to allow users to stay within the filter they chose!

## Step One

- Search parameters are good for something that is going to presist from one user to the next.

- To solve this we are going to use something called history state, this means the browser has a way to save history between one URL and the next, react router has made it very easy to add something to that link state.

- First thing we want to do is add some state to our Link, this will help us pass some state to the next page.

- This is very easy to do, when we are linking to another resource we can pass a prop to that link called `state`, and we can name that state whatever we want and when we get to our next route we can grab that state and it will be that exact string.

- But its better to use an object because it reads better, we also want to pass the information based off our current type filter which is holding our query parameters over to the next route so that the route can grab that information about the type filter so that it knows what filter the user was using to change the link "← Back to all products" so that it can go back to the filters the user has just applied.

- Update: Instead of passing our type filter we will pass our entire query parameter URL this will make our project better if we decide to add more than one filter, instead of only keeping the type filter params like simple, or luxary, it will keep all of them for example if we added sortBy price.

- This should take the entire search param in its stringifyed version and pass it along to the next route that we are linking to.

```js
const vanElements = displayedVans.map(van => (
  <div key={van.id} className='van-tile'>
    <Link to={van.id} state={{ search: searchParams.toString() }}>
      <img src={van.imageUrl} />
      <div className='van-info'>
        <h3>{van.name}</h3>
        <p>
          ${van.price}
          <span>/day</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <i className={`van-type ${van.type} selected`}>{van.type}</i>
    </Link>
  </div>
))
```

# useLocation

## Step One

- Now that we are linking to the detail page and passing the state on with the link we need a way to obtain that state inside of the detail page.

- We can recieve the state coming from the oncoming link inside of the detail page using a hook called `useLocation`.

- First we have to import useLocation.

```js
import { Link, useParams, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom'
```

## Step Two

- Then we can make a variable to obtain the value of useLocation.

- When we console log this object what we get is an object with different keys like pathname, which gives us the path of the current product we are on `/shop/1`, also it gives us `state` which is another object that contains a value called filter, and this contains the `typeFilter` that we applied before we clicked on the current product tht we are viewing.

```js
const location = useLocation()
console.log(location)

// Entire object returned
// {pathname: '/shop/6', search: '', hash: '', state: {…}, key: 'xc4xj2sn'}

// State object
// state: {typeFilter: 'scents'}
```

- Search would contain our query string if we were to have one, for example if we insert `?type=testing` inside of our URL we will get `search: ?type=testing`.

## Step Three

- Even if we do a refresh of our application our link state should now stay. This is what bob meant when he said the browser has its own internal ability to maintain some type of state based on where you are at in the application.

- There is a limit to this, if you send the link to a friend the browser will not save its state meaning that there is nothing in the URL thats hidden or secret about the state we are trying to maintain, its something specific in our browser. (Even if we use a new browser and insert the URL the state would not maintain itself.)

```js
/**
 * Challenge: modify the Link `to` prop below to send the user
 * back to the previous page with the searchParams included, if
 * they exist. (Remember we may not have anything in that state
 * if there were no filters applied before coming to this
 * van detail page, so make sure to "code defensively" to handle
 * that case.)
 */
```
